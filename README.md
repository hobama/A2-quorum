# A2-Quorum

A2-quorum implements a shared-memory abstraction over dynamic sensor networks, using the A2-agreement over the air system for Sky motes running Contiki Os. The goal of the project is to explore the usage of quorum based systems as a means of vehicle coordination, and was developed as a part of the Autonomous and Cooperative vehicular systems course in Chalmers university.

## Abstract

In low-power wireless networking, new applications such as cooperative robots or industrial closed-loop control demand for network-wide agreement at low-latency and high reliability.
Distributed consensus protocols is a mature field of research in a wired context, but has received little attention in low-power wireless settings.
In this paper, we present A2: Agreement in the Air, a system that brings distributed consensus to low-power multi-hop networks.
We introduce Synchrotron, a synchronous transmissions kernel that builds a robust mesh by exploiting the capture effect, frequency hopping with parallel channels, and link-layer security.
We build A2 on top of this reliable base layer, and enable the two- and three-phase commit protocols, as well as network services such as joining, hopping sequence distribution and re-keying.

We evaluate A2 on four public testbeds with different deployment densities and sizes. 
A2 requires only 475 ms to complete a two-phase commit over 180 nodes.
The resulting duty cycle is 0.5 percent for 1-minute intervals.
We show that A2 achieves zero losses end-to-end over long experiments, representing millions of data points.

When further adding controlled failures, we show that two-phase commit ensures transaction consistency in A2 while three-phase commit provides liveness at the expense of inconsistency under specific failure scenarios.

## Implementation

We implement A2 in C for the Contiki OS targeting simple wireless nodes equipped with a low-power radio such as TelosB and Wsn430 platforms which feature a 16bit MSP430 CPU @ 4 MHz, 10 kB of RAM, 48 kB of firmware storage and CC2420 radio compatible with IEEE 802.15.4.

You can browse the main part of the implementation under [core/net/mac/chaos](./a2-synchrotron-contiki/core/net/mac/chaos/).

### Running in Cooja

To run the two-phase commit sample app in Cooja:
Go to [2PC](./a2-synchrotron-contiki/apps/chaos/2pc) and compile using:
```
make clean && make cooja log=0 printf=1 tx=31 mch=1 pch=0 sec=0 src=2 sync=0 failure=0 dynamic=1 initiator=3 interval=29 max_node_count=32
```
Then, start Cooja and choose one of the simulation files. 
For example, this one has [32 nodes](./a2-synchrotron-contiki/apps/chaos/2pc/2pc-app-32nodes.csc).

You can find the other sample applications in the [Apps folder](./a2-synchrotron-contiki/apps/chaos).
